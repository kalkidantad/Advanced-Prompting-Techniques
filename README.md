This repository provides an implementation of various prompting techniques using Gemini-2.0-Flash, a powerful AI model for text generation. The guide includes step-by-step examples, explanations, and best practices for optimizing AI-driven responses.
It covers multiple prompting strategies such as few-shot, zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency sampling, and program-aided debugging. Additionally, it provides insights into selecting appropriate temperature settings for different tasks.

You can modify the model parameters for different behavior.
# Temperature Tuning Guide

- Low temperature (0.3) → Best for deterministic outputs (math, debugging, structured reasoning).
- Moderate temperature (0.5) → Balanced response generation (explanations, reasoning-based queries).
- High temperature (0.7+) → More diverse and creative text generation.

# Best Practices for Effective Prompting

1. Adjust temperature settings based on the task requirements to balance diversity and consistency.
2. Use few-shot examples for tasks requiring structured responses.
3. Apply self-consistency sampling for open-ended, ambiguous tasks to improve reliability.
4. Utilize CoT techniques for step-by-step problem-solving.
5. Combine knowledge generation with dual prompting for better contextual learning.
